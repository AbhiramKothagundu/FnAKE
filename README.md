# FnAKE - A Fully Original Snake Game

## Overview
FnAKE is a simple and addictive snake game implemented in C++. The game is based on the classic snake game concept, where the player controls a snake that moves around the game area, eating fruits to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area.

## Features
- Classic snake gameplay experience
- Simple controls: Use arrow keys or WASD to control the snake's direction
- Randomly spawning fruits that increase the snake's length and score
- Game over screen with final score display
- Main menu with options to start the game or exit

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FnAKE.git
   ```

2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler:

   ```
   g++ -o FnAKE FnAKE.cpp
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

   ```
   ./FnAKE
   ```

## Controls
- Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) or WASD keys to control the snake's movement.
- Press the 'space_bar' to start the game from the main menu.
- Press 'e' to exit the game from the main menu or during gameplay.

## Gameplay
- The snake starts with a single segment.
- Move the snake around the game area to eat fruits and grow longer.
- Avoid colliding with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game area.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
- Try to achieve the highest score possible before the game ends.
